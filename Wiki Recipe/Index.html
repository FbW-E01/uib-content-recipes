        <b>Al pastor</b>  (from Spanish, "shepherd style"), also known as tacos al
        pastor, is a taco made with spit-grilled pork. Based on the lamb
        shawarma brought by Lebanese immigrants from Mexico,al pastor features a
        flavor palate that combines traditional Middle Eastern spices with those
        indigenous to central Mexico. It is a popular street food that has
        spread to the United States. In some places of northern Mexico and
        coastal Mexico, such as in Baja California, Mexico, it is known as taco
        de adobada. A similar dish from Puebla with different spices is tacos
        árabes.

        During the 19th century, variations of a vertically-grilled meat dish,
        now known by several names, started to spread throughout the Ottoman
        Empire. A wave of Lebanese immigrants to Mexico, mainly Christians such
        as the Maronites who have no religious dietary restrictions on eating
        pork, arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and introduced
        the Arab version, shawarma. In the 1960s, Mexican-born progeny of these
        immigrants began opening their own restaurants and combining their
        heritage with Mexican cuisine. Being derived from shawarma, it is also
        similar to the Turkish döner kebab and the Greek gyros.

    <div id="Preparation">
      <h2>Prepartion</h2>
      <p>
        The secret to having the right flavor is in the marinade. Tacos al
        pastor have a distinct flavor and you have to make them right to achieve
        the “al pastor” flavor. A secret to making tacos al pastor is to include
        pineapple juice in the marinade, as well as fresh pieces of grilled
        pineapple on the tacos themselves. One bite of this flavor combination
        and you will be coming back for more! Normally this would be the step
        where you pile the meat on top of each other and put it on the trompo,
        so that it can be cooked slowly while spinning. Since I don’t have a
        trompo, we grilled the meat and then stacked the pieces on top of each
        other before cutting. You will want to grill the pork until it has nice
        grill marks and is cooked all the way through. It should still have a
        red color to it when it is ready to eat. After you take the meat off, go
        ahead and grill the pineapple too.
