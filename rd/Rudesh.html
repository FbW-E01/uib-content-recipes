    <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.[1] Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is usually refrigerated).

        Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored in different ways. Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other ingredients.</p>

        <li>
            Process biscuits in a food processor until finely crushed. Add butter and pulse to combine. Press over the
            base of a 20cm springform pan. Chill for 15 mins or until firm.</li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese and sugar in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Fold
            in the cream. Whisk the gelatine and hot water in a small bowl until the gelatine dissolves. Stir 1/4 cup of
            the cream cheese mixture into the gelatine mixture, then add to the remaining mixture and mix well. Pour
            half the cream cheese mixture over the biscuit base. Top with half the mango slices, then remaining cream
            cheese mixture. Refrigerate overnight or until firm .</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the fridge 15 mins before serving.  To make coulis, place the mango and lime juice
            in a blender and pulse until smooth. (If necessary, blend in a little water until coulis reaches pouring
            consistency.)</li>
        <li>
            Arrange the remaining sliced mango over the cheesecake and drizzle over the coulis.</li>
