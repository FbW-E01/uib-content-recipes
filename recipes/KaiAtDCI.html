        <h2>
            Overview
        </h2>
       <p>
        Tamale pie is prepared with a cornmeal crust and typical tamale fillings 
        arranged in several layers. Beef is traditionally used, but it can also be 
        prepared using other meats such as chicken and turkey meat, and can also be
        prepared as a meatless dish.[3][4][5] Although sometimes characterized as 
        Mexican food, these forms are not popular in Mexican-American culture, in 
        which the individually wrapped style is preferred.[6] Tamale pie has been 
        described as a "comfort-food classic" in the book The Ultimate Casseroles 
        Book, published by Better Homes and Gardens.[7]

            harina, a corn-based tortilla flour.<sup>[2][10][11]</sup> Cheese used may be used 
            to top the dish,[9] and can also be inside of the pie.[7] The dish is 
            typically baked in an oven.[2][8] Garnishes used include cheese, sliced 
            tomatoes, avocado slices, cilantro and olive oil.[2]

       <h2>
           History
       </h2>
       <p>
            Tamale pie was invented sometime in the early 1900s in the United States, 
            and circa the mid 1910s the dish was included in the curriculums of some 
            home economics classes in U.S. high schools.[6] The dish may have originated 
            in the U.S. state of Texas.<sup>[2]</sup> John F. Mariani's 1983 title The Encyclopedia 
            of American Food and Drink claims the first published recipe for tamale pie 
            dates to 1911.[8] Recipes for this style of dish were also published prior 
            to this time.[6] The 1899 book The Capitol Cook Book, published in Austin, 
            Texas included a recipe for a similar pot pie prepared with a wheat flour 
            crust on the top of the dish, and the 1905 book The Times Cook Book #2, 
            published by the Los Angeles Times, included a recipe for a casserole with 
            "cornmeal crusts above and below."[6] Another cookbook published circa the 
            time of World War I has a tamale pie recipe, stating that the dish can be 
            utilized to save wheat.<sup>[6]</sup>
